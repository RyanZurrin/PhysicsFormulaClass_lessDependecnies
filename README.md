# PhysicsFormulaClass_lessDependecnies
This is cloned from one of my other projects that was built in Visual Studio which had a lot of additional dependencies installed like eigen3, gsl, symengine, and a
few others which made it  very hard to clone and use. This module has all the same funtionality mostly and can be used simply my cloning and building the project. 
I recomend using  clion or some editor that has build  tools built in that make building and using easy. 

The testFacory.cpp file is where you would call the static methods and use  the functionality of the physics world modules.
